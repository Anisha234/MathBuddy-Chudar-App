# MathBuddy App

MathBuddy is an Android application created for the nonprofit Chudar which provides academic support to underserved children in India. MathBuddy aims to provide students with consistent learning to help with preparation for the NMMS (National Means-Cum-Merit Scholarship) exam. It provides structured exercises, progress tracking, and AI-powered problem generation to support learning in low-resource environments.

## Overview

MathBuddy gives students a simple interface to practice Algebra, Number Theory, and Statistics, while allowing teachers and volunteers to introduce consistent, self-paced math practice. The app works offline for core features and syncs with AI services only when needed.

---

## Key Features

MathBuddy provides students with four core math practice areas:

- **Algebra**
- **Geometry**
- **Number Theory**
- **Statistics**

Students select a topic from the Practice Screen and work through curated questions with instant feedback and explanations.

---

### Topic-Based Practice
Each subject includes:
- Multiple-choice questions  
- Instant feedback  
- Step-by-step explanations  
- Preset question banks stored locally in the app  
- Test mode

###  AI-Powered Functionality
MathBuddy integrates two external APIs: OpenAI API and Wolfram Alpha API, which are used to generate new practice questions, check correctness of mathematical expressions, and validate AI-generated questions. 
These APIs allow MathBuddy to expand beyond preset content while keeping learning grounded and accurate.
